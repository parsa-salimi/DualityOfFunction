# DualityOfFunction
This inefficient Racket code implements the Fredman Khachiyan algorithm for detecting if two given formulas in DNF are dual.

DNF.rkt contains the representation of DNF's, together with helper functions
Generator.rkt contains codes for generating specific DNF's
fk-1.rkt is the main algorithm implementation
treegen.rkt visualises the algorithm
