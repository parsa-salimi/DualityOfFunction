### about 
This repository implements the Fredman Khachiyan algorithm for checking the Duality of two monotone Boolean functions given in disjunctive normal form. It also provides utilities for dual generation, pattern matching, and generation of all monotone Boolean function of a given size. The code also provides code for visualizing the recursion tree, and profiling tools for measuring the efficiancy of the algorithm on various examples.
